# This code makes you jump all the
# way to the top of the screen
# and hover there until you turn off
# the code.  If you press the
# jump button twice, you will keep spinning
# around and around with your sabre out,
# killing all enemies (until you turn the
# code off).  This code is mainly
# for fun or experimenting.
